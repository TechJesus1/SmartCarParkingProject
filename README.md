# SmartCarParkingProject
The Smart Car Parking System aims to streamline the process of finding parking spaces in urban areas. Traditional parking systems require drivers to search for available spots, often resulting in wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and traffic congestion. By implementing a smart system that displays available parking slots in real-time, drivers can find parking spaces efficiently and conveniently. This system aims to reduce the time and effort spent by drivers in locating parking spaces, thereby improving overall traffic flow and reducing pollution in busy city areas.

# Existing Working:
Existing parking systems typically lack real-time information about available spaces, leading to unnecessary driving and congestion. Some systems utilize basic sensors and display boards, but these often fail to provide accurate and timely updates. The current systems do not effectively communicate with drivers before they reach the parking area, resulting in increased traffic as drivers circle around searching for an open spot. Additionally, existing systems often do not account for dynamic changes in parking availability, leading to outdated information being displayed.

# Problem Statement:
With the growing population and increasing number of vehicles, the current parking systems are insufficient. Drivers often struggle to find available parking spots, causing delays and contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. The lack of real-time information about parking availability exacerbates the problem, as drivers are left to aimlessly search for open spaces. There is a critical need for a system that can provide real-time updates on parking availability to alleviate these issues. The Smart Car Parking System addresses this need by providing accurate, up-to-date information on available parking slots, thus reducing the time and effort required to find a parking spot.
